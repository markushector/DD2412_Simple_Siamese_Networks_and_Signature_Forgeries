# DD2412_Simple_Siamese_Networks_and_Signature_Forgeries
Github containing our code for our school project about representation learning with simple siamese networks and signature detection at KTH (Royal Institute of Technology).

The code containing the siamese networks as well as resnet-18 for Cifar can be found in the folder "simsiam". The trained models are saved under "nets".

The notebook "avg_pool_net" contains the code to perform linear evaluation on a saved network.

The notebook "simsiam_resnet18" contains code to train models as well as evaluate their performance with a kNN classifier.
